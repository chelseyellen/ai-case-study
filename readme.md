### Origin
CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 by George Kurtz, Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston with a specific mission to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based technology to allow for flexible and adaptive protection against the increasingly complex cybersecurity threat landscape. George Kurtz, who formerly served as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) with McAfee, was frustrated with how slowly existing security solutions responded to rapidly evolving threats and threat actors around the world. The three founders partnered together to bring the power of AI into the fold for cybersecurity by founding CrowdStrike and launching their flagship product CrowdStrike Falcon.

## CrowdStrike as a Business
---
### Business Model & Revenue Streams
CrowdStrike deploys a **Land and Expand** business model where they offer free trials to prospective customers with the aim of converting them to paying customers and to existing customers to deepen the existing relationship. CrowdStrike primarily generates revenue through professional services support and subscription licensing of its products. Professional services such as incident response, forensic and malware analysis, and attribution analysis and industry-wide partnerships account for 7% of its revenue. Annual subscription fees for CrowdStrike Falcon and cloud modules account for 93% of its revenue.

CrowdStrike states that it has...
>"...redefined security with the world’s most advanced cloud-native platform that protects and enables the people, processes and technologies that drive modern enterprise. CrowdStrike secures the most critical areas of risk – endpoints and cloud workloads, identity, and data – to keep customers ahead of today’s adversaries and stop breaches."

### Artificial Intelligence
CrowdStrike utilizes Artificial Intelligence from the ground up in their products:
* **Proactive Threat Detection**: AI algorithms analyze the attack surface for customers via endpoint protection and instantly responds when suspicious behavior is identified
* **Behavioral Analysis**: These AI models are designed to learn and understand standard behaviors to more easily differentiate between standard and suspicious behaviors; learnings are incorporated in real time allowing for anomalies to be detected more easily 
* **Automated Response**: CrowdStrike utilizes multiple methods of automated responses such as automated response alerts and an AI Chatbot called Charlotte to answer customer questions
* **Scalability**: CrowdStrike is easily able to scale its offerings due to the massive amounts of data that can be consumed, processed, and analyzed by its products

CrowdStrike offers a layered approach utilizing AI, and that is represented well in this visualization:

### Customers
CrowdStrike focuses its attention on being at the cutting edge of cyber threat detection and protection, therefore the target customer for their product is vast. CrowdStrike has over 23,000 customers with a focus on governments and commercial businesses with notable customers such as Goldman Sachs, Lumen Technologies, Rackspace, and Shutterstock. [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/about-us/) touts the following statistics regarding their customers:
* They service 61 of 100 Fortune 100 companies
* Out of the 100 top Global Companies, 37 are CrowdStrike clients

These customers tend to be devoted due to the ever-changing cybersecurity threat landscape and the staggeringly short amount of time it takes for the AI-driven technology to detect and alert customers to a possible threat.

Their Stackshare site indicates that CrowdStrike currently utilizes JavaScript, Python, Docker, jQuery, and Java in their products. [StackShare](https://stackshare.io/crowdstrike/crowdstrike)

## Landscape

### Landscape
CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that has been at the forefront of AI adoption for navigating the increasingly complex landscape of protection across the internet. The trends within the field are vast and complex - from amateur internet pranks to large-scale, state-funded bad actors searching for ways to infiltrate infrastructure across the world. A such, their competitors are also vast ranging from industry veterans to startups. Some competitors are:
* Cisco
* Cloudflare
* McAfee
* Microsoft
* Okta
* Palo Alto Networks
* SentinelOne
* Sophos
* Zscaler

CrowdStrike is a market share leader in endpoint security protection with 17.7% market share of the entire $8.6 billion industry. Microsoft holds 16.4% of that market share as of June 2022.

## Results
---
### Results
CrowdStrike has proven wildly successful in their business model and the impact they have had on the cybersecurity industry. CrowdStrike was one of the first companies within the industry to utilize artificial intelligence in their business model, and the Falcon product was a pioneer in the cloud-native endpoint security space and offered one of a kind real-time threat detection and response. 

Some high-profile cases of CrowdStrike successfully defeating bad actors across the cybersecurity space range from the [2016 Democratic National Convention](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/) to the [Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/customer-stories/mercedes-amg-petronas-f1-team/) by successfully squashing events within 24 hours of their discovery. This has revolutionized the industry by taking attacks that would impact a company for weeks or months at a time and lessening that timeframe into hours or days. 

This success is reflected in their stock price: the company debut IPO stock price was listed at $34.00 and today the stock is above $340.00 per share. In addition, CrowdStrike led the way of revolutionizing the cybersecurity industry and, as a result, many top companies across the world deploy CrowdStrike Falcon leading to a 17.7% share of the endpoint cybersecurity market.

## Recommendations

### My Recommendations
CrowdStrike is at the forefront of their field of cybersecurity and have revolutionized the industry by embedding artificial intelligence in their product offerings. I believe the next approach to revolutionize the industry is to adopt a "white hat hacker" approach and get in the minds of bad actors to anticipate their next moves. This could be as simple as reviewing the attack surface of a company and advising on which areas need to be reinforced due to understanding prime target areas or getting in the mind of the state-funded bad actors to discern which methods will be invented next to continue to target high profile or vulnerable industries and companies.

Proactive and anticipatory cybersecurity support is relatively impossible, but if CrowdStrike could deploy artificial intelligence to understand the future landscape, then we would all be a bit more secure.
